<h1>St Lawrence School of Football - Inspiring Excellence</h1>
<p>St Lawrence School of Football is an amateur, youth, community football club based in North West London. They are a club that have helped and developed many young talented footballers players, some even going on to play professionally in the football leagues. As a community charity-funded football club, they're always on the lookout for local talent, both on and off the field. That means, to continue their good work, they require players, coaches or volunteers to be able to find them and join the club. They also require a location where existing players, parents and staff can go to find out details of upcoming matches and games.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<p>The aim of this website is to provide a simple to use, easy to navigate one-stop-shop for both existing and new potential players, parents, coaches and volunteers. The goal is to inform existing members of crucial weekly details such as training time and location, as well as match. The website also aims to encourage potential new players to sign up, by educating them on the incredible ethos of the club, as well as informing them on the qualified credentials of the coaches, who themselves aim to inspire excellence.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Users can scroll through the website and find the information that is relevant to them, in an easy, intuitive way. I aim to serve the user in both web and mobile format, as young people are more likely on their phones nowadays. The user can also contact the club should they require more information.</p>


<h3>Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Home: The website will be a one page website split into dropdown sections. This was chosen to reduce the cognitive load on the users and make the site easy to navigate.</li>
<li>Next match section: Details about the upcoming fixture. Put at the top for the benefit of existing players/parents, as that's likely going to be the .</li>
<li>About us section: Informs potential parents, coaches, volunters and players about the club ethos</li>
<li>The team section: Details the coaching/management team and their role/credentials/qualifications</li>
<li>Join us section: Informs potential players of training locations and times</li>
<li>Contact us: If parents, volunteers or players have queries, they can reach out to the team here</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skeleton</h2>
<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>I created wireframes using Balsqmiz for both web and mobile formation:<br><br>
<a href="assets/images/wireframes/Desktop UI.png">Web format</a><br>
<a href="assets/images/wireframes/Mobile UI.png">Mobile format</a>
</p>

<h2>Surface</h2>
<p>In order to highlight Join as the main focus/goal, I'll put that on a banner at the top, although this can always change, according to whatever the main goal is for that month. It could aslo act as a news carousel.<br><br>

<b>Colour Scheme</b><br><br>
The colour scheme will be St Lawrence specifice. It makes sense to go with the club's playing colours. That being yellowy-gold, black and white (from the logo). I used a colour picker to get the hex codes for these.

<b>Typograhy</b><br><br>
The main font used is a sans-serif font 'Lato' with an alternative/backup as sans-serif, if it is not accessible. This font is clear, clean, modern and inspirational, which is in-keeping with the motto of St Lawrence FC.

<b>Imagery</b><br><br>
Images on this website are responsive, and doesn't suffer from interference from the backgound.

<p>I tested in 2  different browsers and across multiple breakpoints to ensure responsiveness. I also used googletools inspect and check it worked well across all devices on there.<br><br>
I checked and tested the Sign up form, the hover over states, the click through, the accessibility, the aria labels. I ensured that the form had the correct fields attributed to it (can't submit invalid email, etc).
<br>
I tested on: 
OS Compatibility - Windows 7 & 10, Android 10.0 and MacOS Big Sur v11.2.3. It has not as yet been tested on other Operating Systems.
<br><br>
Devices - The devices used in testing include an Oppo X2 Lite, Samsung 10, Asus x555l
<br><br>
Chrome DevTools - This website was thoroughly tests for responsiveness on Chrome DevTools. Viewport sizes from small (e.g. iPhone5), to large (Desktop 1200px and above) were simulated.
</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>Solved bugs: When I deployed the code to the Github pages, I did notice that the images were quite heavy, so I had to resize and compress them, and reupload them. I also noticed that the St Lawrence navigation title wasn't showing well on the very smallest mobile screen, so I had to resize it for better for that specific breakpoint.</p>

<h2>Validator testing</h2>
<p>
W3C Markup Validator - Home Page - Pass - No errors present<br>
W3C CSS3 validator - Pass - No errors present<br>
Accessibilty - I can confirm the colours and fonts worked well and was easy to read by running through it in Lighthouse (in devtools). The only thing that may be an issue is the Perfrmance of the website due to the JS files loaded. <a href="assets/images/wireframes/lighthouse.png">Results shown here</a><br>
<b>Unfixed bugs</b><br>
All are largely related to performance issues. If I had more time, I'd more likely looks to reolsve those.

<h2>Credits</h2>

<b>Code</b><br>
Bootstrap library was used to for the navbar, image carousel, form, grids and card components. It was also used for the grid layout and responsive design. I also used the guidelines and sample structure from the Love Running project from the Code Institute.
